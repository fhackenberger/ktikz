/*!
 * \brief Wrapper around a QFile or, in the KDE version, QSaveFile object.
 *
 * This class is a wrapper around a QFile object.  In the KDE version, if the
 * OpenMode is File::WriteOnly, then it is a wrapper around a QSaveFile object.
 * This class also handles opening and saving remote files using KIO
 * transparently.
 *
 * \section Initialization
 * Before any File object is created, the main widget to which the dialogs
 * created by File must be modal and the temporary directory in which File
 * will put temporary files must be specified:
 * \code
 *     File::setMainWidget(mainWindow);
 *     File::setTempDir("/path/to/existing/directory");
 * \endcode
 * This must be done only once during the execution of the application,
 * before any File object is created.
 *
 * \section File-reading-files Reading files
 * The following example shows how to read a text file:
 * \code
 *     File f("filename.txt", File::ReadOnly);
 *     if (!f.open(QFile::Text))
 *         qDebug() << "Cannot read file filename.txt: " + f.errorString();
 *     QTextStream ts(f.file());
 *     QString fileContents = ts.readAll();
 *     if (!f.close())
 *         qDebug() << "Cannot close file filename.txt: " + f.errorString();
 * \endcode
 * When using KDE the first argument to the File constructor can also be a
 * remote URL (the rest of the code doesn't change in this case).
 *
 * The file doesn't have to be closed explicitly.  It is closed when the File
 * object is destroyed.
 *
 * \section File-writing-files Writing files:
 * The next example shows how to write a file:
 * \code
 *     File f("filename.txt", File::WriteOnly);
 *     if (!f.open())
 *         qDebug() << "Cannot write file filename.txt: " + f.errorString();
 *     QTextStream ts(f.file());
 *     ts << "Some text.\n";
 *     if (!f.close())
 *         qDebug() << "Cannot close file filename.txt: " + f.errorString();
 * \endcode
 * When using KDE the first argument to the File constructor can also be a
 * remote URL (the rest of the code doesn't change in this case).
 *
 * The file doesn't have to be closed explicitly.  It is closed when the File
 * object is destroyed.
